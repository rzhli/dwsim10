    ''' <summary>
    ''' Closed-form temperature and composition (mole-number) derivatives of the fugacity coefficients for
    ''' the generalized two-parameter cubic EOS shared by Peng-Robinson and Soave-Redlich-Kwong. Both EOS
    ''' use the same fugacity expression
    '''   ln(phi_i) = (b_i/b_m)(Z-1) - ln(Z-B) - A/((e1-e2)B) * (2*aml2_i/a_m - b_i/b_m) * ln((Z+e1*B)/(Z+e2*B))
    ''' and the same cubic Z^3 + c2 Z^2 + c1 Z + c0 = 0, differing only in the constants
    ''' (Omega_a, Omega_b, kappa(w), e1, e2). Everything is derived analytically from those; the Z-root is
    ''' obtained from the same CalcZ2 root-finder used by CalcLnFugCPU so the derivative is taken on the
    ''' identical root branch. Results are validated element-by-element against finite differences in
    ''' DWSIM.Thermodynamics.Derivatives.Tests.
