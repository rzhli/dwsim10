Furthermore, BP and SR methods are generally restricted to limited specifications.

As discussed by Goldstein and Stanfield, grouping of functions by type is computationally most efficient for problems involving many components, but few stages. For problems involving many stages but relatively few components, it is most efficient to group the functions according to stage location. The latter grouping, presented here, is described by Naphtali and was implemented by Naphtali and Sandholm.")

A two-phase feed can be sent to the same stage or the vapor can be directed to the stage above. Stage pressures and stage efficiencies can be designated by specifying top- and bottom-stage values with remaining values obtained by linear interpolation. By default, intermediate stages are assumed adiabatic unless Qj or Tj values are specified. Vapor and/or liquid sidestreams can be designated in terms of total flow or flow rate of a specified component, or by the ratio of the sidestream flow to the flow rate passing to the next stage. The top- and bottom-stage specifications are selected from Q1 or QN, and/or from the other specifications.")

Rather than provide these a priori, they can be generated if T, V, and L are guessed for the bottom and top stages and, perhaps, for one or more intermediate stages. Remaining guessed Tj, Vj, and Lj values are obtained by linear interpolation of the Tj values and computed (Vj=Lj) values. Initial values for yij and lij are then obtained by either of two techniques.

When employing the above equation, most problems converge in 10 iterations or fewer. The convergence criterion is far from satisfied during the first iteration with guessed values for the output variables. For subsequent iterations, Newton–Raphson corrections can be added directly to the present values of the output variables to obtain a new set of output variables. Alternatively, a damping factor can be employed where t is a nonnegative, scalar step factor. At each iteration, a value of t is applied to all output variables. By permitting t to vary from slightly greater than 0 up to 2, it can dampen or accelerate convergence, as appropriate. For each iteration, a t that minimizes the sum of the squares is sought. Generally, optimal values of t proceed from an initial value for the second iteration at between 0 and 1 to a value nearly equal to or slightly greater than 1 when the criterion is almost satisfied. If there is no optimal value of t in the designated range, t can be set to 1, or some smaller value, and the sum of squares can be allowed to increase. Generally, after several iterations, the sum of squares decreases for every iteration.")
