==================================================

Version 10.2.5

- [NEW] PC-SAFT now handles polymers. A polymer's chain length grows with its molar mass (m = (m/M)·Mn), and parameters ship for polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene, polyisobutene, polystyrene and poly(vinyl acetate). You can compute polymer-solvent phase behaviour, including a polymer solution splitting into a lean and a concentrated liquid.
- [CHG] PC-SAFT is more reliable and faster. The density is found by searching the physically valid range, so it lands on the right liquid root at any composition, and the density and fugacity routines run several times quicker. It now works with fugacity in log form throughout, so very long-chain molecules (whose fugacity coefficient is otherwise too small to represent) are handled correctly.
- [CHG] Polymer liquid-liquid splits now converge by minimizing the two-phase Gibbs energy, which steers away from the false "single-phase" answer that a narrow polymer miscibility gap used to trap the solver in. The two liquids are told apart by mass fraction, and the calculation reports its best split instead of failing when a case is slow to settle.
- [FIX] Changing the object a level gauge, analog or digital gauge, switch, input, or PID controller reads no longer crashes DWSIM (issue #61).
- [FIX] A PID controller placed on the flowsheet before its controlled and manipulated objects are set no longer prints an "Object reference" error next to its icon (issue #61).

Version 10.2.4

- [NEW] MCP Server and Assistant API: set up and read any unit operation, including Recycle, Energy Recycle, Spec and Adjust, using whatever name you know a property by, and read its results back.
- [NEW] MCP Server and Assistant API: start and steer a dynamic simulation, and ask what is wrong with a flowsheet without solving it.
- [NEW] Object palette: a third-party unit operation (a DLL in the unitops folder that isn't part of the base or Patreon edition) gets its own section, named after the developer or suite it belongs to, on both interfaces.
- [NEW] Pipe network: it can take part in a dynamic simulation, re-solving in steady state at each pressure-flow step against the boundaries of that moment, with a re-solve rate, a fail mode and a time limit per step (higher subscription tier).
- [NEW] Pipe network: the valve opening, choke bean, ESP frequency, pressure-control-valve setting and gas-lift casing pressure ease toward a new command with a first-order lag and dead time, instead of jumping to it.
- [NEW] Pipe network: every block publishes its properties to the flowsheet as "<block>: <property>", so a PID can read a node pressure and drive a valve opening.
- [NEW] Dynamics Wizard, on both interfaces: it tells you what stands between a converged flowsheet and a dynamic run, suggests a value for each item, and sets up the integrator, schedule and monitored variables for you.
- [NEW] Pipe network: a dynamic sample, a water main feeding a break tank through a pressure-reducing valve, with a controller holding the tank level by moving the valve.
- [NEW] Pipe network: a pressure-temperature property table for a fixed composition. The branch reads a tabulated flash (vapour fraction, phase densities, viscosities, enthalpy and per-compound phase compositions) instead of flashing at every step.
- [CHG] Salt precipitation: the solid-liquid flash now uses a solubility product for salts, the outer loop stops re-dissolving what it precipitates, and dissolved salts stay in the pressure and vapour-fraction flash.
- [CHG] PID controller: an optional span on the manipulated variable scales the output around a bias, for a loop whose two variables differ in unit and size.
- [CHG] Pipe network: the compositional outer loop stops once it stops improving and returns its most consistent pass, cutting the well cases to about a third of the time.
- [CHG] Automation interface: a flowsheet you open through it can be handed the repaint callback the solver uses, so a host program can colour objects by status while a solve runs.
- [CHG] Pipe network: an option solves each pipe on two grids and cancels the leading discretisation error, reaching a converged answer for about twice the cost (off by default).
- [CHG] Pipe network: the nodal solver uses an analytic Beggs-Brill pressure-drop gradient, so multiphase branches converge with fewer correlation evaluations.
- [CHG] Pipe network: an option relaxes each pipe's energy balance by Wegstein's method, reaching the same answer in far fewer passes on pipes that exchange heat (off by default).
- [CHG] Pipe network: the default pipe temperature tolerance is now 0.01 K, was 0.1 K.
- [CHG] Pipe network: a compositional pipe also re-flashes based on how far the fluid has travelled, not only on a step count.
- [CHG] Pipe network: a branch can read tabulated fluid properties instead of flashing, and stops using the table when it isn't saving time.
- [CHG] Pipe network: the pipe flash and energy-balance settings sit on the network property list, next to the tolerances and iteration limits.
- [FIX] Cross-platform editors: a decimal like 0.965 was read as 965 where the locale uses a period as the thousands separator, corrupting the composition. Numbers are now parsed without a thousands separator.
- [FIX] Peng-Robinson and SRK: near the critical point the liquid root could fall at or below the covolume and give an impossible liquid density. The physical root is now chosen above the covolume with a density limit, and the trivial single-phase answer is rejected (issue #40).
- [FIX] Distillation: a column with no pressure drop set left its stage pressures at zero and would not solve. They are now filled in from the condenser and reboiler pressures (issue #38).
- [FIX] Vapor Compression Chiller: the saturated vapour and liquid states come from the vapour-fraction flash on a molar basis, and the shaft power is written to a connectable shaft port that takes a duty specification.
- [FIX] Fired Heater: it fires for the duty you ask of it, writes the resulting fuel flow back to its fuel stream, and no longer rejects the geometry it ships with.
- [FIX] Fired Heater: a burner running well below its surface area no longer fails with a NaN flue-gas temperature; no section can absorb more heat than the fuel releases.
- [FIX] Advanced Heat Exchanger: Simulation mode now solves for the exchanger's own duty.
- [FIX] Refining unit operations: outlet temperatures and mass balances close, and the duty ports are connectable.
- [FIX] Neutralization reactor: its energy balance closes.
- [FIX] Precipitation reactor: it no longer invents a sludge stream, and the reordering of its solid outlet was dropped.
- [FIX] Zeolite adsorber: the raffinate now carries the feed pressure instead of its enthalpy.
- [FIX] Restriction orifice: it iterates on the flow it is solving for.
- [FIX] Air Cooler 2: an internal name-resolution error is fixed.
- [FIX] Material and energy stream switches report an unset routing expression instead of failing silently.
- [FIX] Pipe network: loading a saved network fills it in cleanly instead of piling up duplicate blocks, a boundary that ran backwards is re-set, and a newly added block gets its connectors.
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: the Equipment Database catalog import dialogs stay attached to the main window.
- [FIX] A simulation saved by a host program that never used the spreadsheet could not be reopened.
- [FIX] Anaerobic Digester (ADM1-Full): an impossible feed rate is refused instead of settling into a meaningless steady state that still claims to have converged.
- [FIX] Pipe network: compositional networks that would not converge now do. Relaxation follows the residual, Beggs-Brill gets a holdup clamp and a transition-inclination correction, and a flow rate the pipe cannot handle is approached through a smooth barrier.
- [FIX] Pipe network: a boundary running against the way it's drawn is refused before anything is written, so a rejected solve leaves the flowsheet untouched.
- [FIX] Pipe network: the critical (sonic) choke transition is smooth instead of a kink the solver couldn't follow.
- [FIX] PID controller: a controller driven from automation, or restored from a file whose editor was never opened, now resolves the object it manipulates.
- [FIX] Phase envelope: a package with no analytical critical point, or an envelope whose bubble and dew curves don't meet, falls back to the pseudo-critical point instead of failing.
- [FIX] An empty object entry in an older file no longer costs the whole flowsheet its objects and connections.
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: editor rows that were hard to read on the dark theme.
- [FIX] Welcome screen: the FOSSEE flowsheet listing is fetched over https.
- [FIX] Splash screen: fonts come from the system message-box font.
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: the editors' "Linked to" row shows the spec or adjust attached to the object, as on Windows, and is hidden when there is none.
- [FIX] Windows interface: dragging objects from the palette froze DWSIM after a few drags (a graphics-handle leak, "A generic error occurred in GDI+"). The drag cursor is built once now (issue #44).
- [FIX] Pipe network: compositional results move with this release's liquid-density correction. Every compositional sample was re-solved and now matches the engine, with rates shifting by up to 16%.
- [FIX] Anaerobic Digester (ADM1): a fixed outlet temperature now drives the biochemistry, acid-base equilibria and gas transfer, which used to run at the feed temperature whatever the Thermal Mode said.
- [FIX] Property packages: a compound with no valid heat of vaporisation (a normal boiling point above its critical temperature, or a NaN from a bad critical pressure) no longer poisons mixture enthalpy and drags a mixer outlet to the enthalpy datum temperature.
- [FIX] Pipe network: a stuck compositional solve no longer reports itself converged; the outer loop now also requires the inner solve to converge, and the choke exposes a Critical Flow Ratio.
- [FIX] Pipe network: a critical (sonic) branch switches regime in the solver (rate held at the critical value, energy equation dropped) instead of being pushed back by a penalty.
- [FIX] Pipe network: the direct-evaluation vs surrogate choice is fixed for the life of a warm start, so a network returns the same result every solve.
- [FIX] Mixer: an inlet with zero mass flow (the empty phase of an upstream split, for instance) no longer fails the mixer with a NaN-enthalpy error; it is skipped (issue #45).
- [FIX] Python Script: the Python 3 standard library is bundled and on the search path, so a Python Script unit operation and flowsheet scripts can import stdlib modules like pathlib and json on every platform (issue #46).
- [FIX] Spreadsheet: a cell reading a property or another cell no longer shows a stale or zero value on first open; the sheet recalculates once its data and custom functions are in place.
- [FIX] OPC-UA Client plugin: it opens again instead of failing to find one of its own files; DWSIM now looks in the plugin's own folder (plugins/opclibraries) for its private dependencies.
- [FIX] Dynamic simulation: the dynamic-mode property window opens for a tank, gas-liquid separator, reactor, distillation column or pipe instead of failing to open (issue #49).
- [FIX] Dynamic simulation: clicking a monitored variable in the integrator settings no longer crashes the cross-platform interface (issue #50).
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: changing the manipulated or controlled object of a controller no longer crashes DWSIM (issue #48).
- [FIX] Pipe network editor: the temperature and pressure tolerance fields were swapped in their boxes; the stored values are worth checking in simulations saved earlier.
- [FIX] Pipe segment: no heat transfer was reported, and the increment stopped iterating, where the fluid crossed the ambient temperature along an increment.
- [FIX] Pipe network: the nodal solver's outer loop compared temperature against a pressure tolerance; a gas condensate now returns the same answer when solved repeatedly.
- [FIX] Phase envelope: the dew line no longer draws a spurious spike past the critical point, seen on an equimolar methane/ethane mixture with Peng-Robinson 1978.
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: an active toolbar toggle (Flowsheet Calculator Active, Simultaneous Adjust Solver) no longer hides its icon.

Version 10.2.3

- [NEW] Anaerobic Digester (ADM1-Full): a feed-alkalinity input, so a buffered substrate such as manure sets the charge-balance pH and gives a methane-richer biogas.
- [NEW] Pipe network designer: a snap-to-grid canvas (on by default, saved with the network), property and master property tables on the canvas, and an Insert menu for the well and flow-control equipment.
- [CHG] Pipe network: the compositional nodal solver re-solves an edited network much faster, evaluating pipes directly on a warm start and only refining cold solves.
- [FIX] Anaerobic Digester (ADM1-Full): the substrate is built from its elemental formula and fed as a mix of carbohydrate, protein, lipid and inerts, so the conversion is realistic and its nitrogen leaves as ammonia instead of everything acting like fully-degradable carbohydrate.
- [FIX] Anaerobic Digester: hydraulic loading uses the total feed instead of the flashed liquid, so a slurry feed no longer gets an unrealistically long retention time.
- [FIX] A chemical formula with fractional atom counts is now read correctly, so a lumped biomass formula keeps its sulfur and the digester produces H2S.
- [FIX] Property package editor: clicking Configure on a CAPE-OPEN property package no longer crashes.
- [FIX] Compound Creator: the Standard Enthalpy of Formation label is no longer clipped.
- [FIX] Pipe network: cloning a non-empty network no longer throws, the network block and its boundary streams are laid out on the flowsheet, and editing a network property no longer overwrites a Source feed.

Version 10.2.2

- [NEW] Pipe network: a deviation survey (measured depth, inclination, azimuth) builds vertical, horizontal or directional tubing by minimum curvature, on the full pressure and temperature balance.
- [NEW] Pipe network: Fetkovich and Darcy radial inflow performance relations, alongside linear PI and Vogel.
- [NEW] Pipe network: gas-lift valve mechanics, the injection rate from Thornhill-Craver critical orifice flow through the valve port.
- [NEW] Pipe network: a Production Well template (reservoir, IPR, tubing, wellhead) on the designer.
- [NEW] Pipe network: seven new samples, a production well, wellhead choke, water injection, multi-well pad, pressure-reducing valve, pipeline pump stations and a gas-condensate well.
- [CHG] Pipe network designer: an equipment editor opens instantly, building its Results tab only when you look at it.
- [CHG] A refreshed User Guide and rebuilt offline help, generated from the built-in help system, including the pipe network chapter.
- [CHG] Pipe: Weymouth and Panhandle A/B single-phase gas pipeline pressure-drop equations, with a configurable pipeline efficiency factor.

- [FIX] Reaction Manager no longer fails when you add a component that isn't already in the reaction.
- [FIX] Pipe network designer: the Solve and Abort toolbar buttons are no longer oversized.
- [FIX] Pipe network designer (Windows): Ctrl, Shift and Alt reach the canvas again, restoring multi-selection and Shift-drag.
- [FIX] Distillation and absorption columns in dynamic mode: the column seeds its tray and sump holdups from the steady-state solution and no longer fails with a "needs to be (re)initialized" error.
- [FIX] Dynamic Properties and user-defined property editors no longer throw when opened and now list their properties.

Version 10.2.1

- [CHG] Vapour thermal conductivity is corrected for pressure with the Stiel-Thodos dense-gas method.
- [CHG] MCP Server: address simulation objects by tag, list their ids and canvas positions, and rename them.
- [CHG] The compositional pipe-network nodal solver is faster, using a response-surface model and a steadier outer loop.
- [CHG] Automatic and natural flowsheet layout orient objects along the flow and lay recycle loops out as a rectangle.
- [CHG] Cross-platform interface: one scaling factor sizes fonts, controls and menu icons together (issue #17).
- [CHG] Cross-platform interface: the docked object editor gets a close button and roomier rows.
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: deleting a material stream releases its ports, removes the connection lines and takes it out of the inlet/outlet lists (#22, #24).
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: undocking a panel no longer leaves it blank when it's docked again (#25).
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: the DWSIM Assistant helper is closed when DWSIM exits (#23).
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: connect mode joins two objects by clicking the source and then the target (#21).
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: the property-package selector no longer adds a package on type-ahead, only when you deliberately pick one (#18).
- [FIX] Flash (PV/PH/PS): an unconverged temperature is rejected instead of flowing on as a misleading result; the PV flash starts near the dew point.
- [FIX] macOS: DWSIM no longer crashes on the embedded web view, and the assistant helper ships executable (#13).
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: a tool opening a web page falls back to the system browser where there is no embedded view.
- [FIX] Extensions folder: an already-loaded extension isn't loaded a second time.
- [FIX] Steam Tables: a flash stays inside the range the correlations are fitted to.
- [FIX] Anaerobic Digester: the biogas composition splits CO2, NH3 and water vapour correctly.
- [FIX] Dynamic Heat Exchanger: the cell pressure is floored at the minimum pressure.

- [FIX] Missing biomass and extra compounds restored in the shared distribution content (issue #28).
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: the master property table editor keeps its object and property selection.

Version 10.2

- [NEW] Cross-platform interface: property tables, master tables, spreadsheet tables, charts, text blocks, rectangles, buttons and pictures can be placed on a flowsheet and configured.
- [NEW] Cross-platform interface: utilities can be attached to a flowsheet object, and a simulation that already has them keeps them on opening.
- [NEW] Cross-platform interface: the DWSIM Assistant opens docked to the right, loads from the program folder and starts its server in the background, with its button on the menu bar.
- [NEW] Cross-platform interface: manage your compound databases from the welcome screen, adding, creating, removing databases and viewing or deleting their compounds.
- [NEW] Cross-platform interface: backup copies are offered back at startup when the previous run did not close normally.
- [NEW] Assay Manager: assays saved and loaded as XML, with the old binary format still read.
- [NEW] The Forced Solids tab is back on the advanced property package editor, next to Property Overrides.
- [NEW] Cross-platform interface: the Natural Gas Properties and Heat of Combustion Calculator plugins are back, on the Plugins menu.
- [CHG] IPOPT is now a managed solver shipped with DWSIM, checked against the native library over five thousand problems.
- [CHG] The Gibbs reactor initial estimate is solved by a managed simplex instead of the native lpsolve55.
- [CHG] Petalas-Aziz two-phase pressure drop is converted from a native library to managed code.
- [CHG] Automation and Fluent API: column specification types accept their common spellings.
- [CHG] Gibbs reactor: the optimiser stops once the answer is good enough, instead of chasing a tolerance no solver reaches.
- [CHG] The Reaktoro property package and Gibbs reactor call Reaktoro 2 directly; no Python distribution is needed any more.
- [CHG] CoolProp is updated to 8.0.1 and available on Linux and macOS, x64 and ARM, not only x64 Windows.
- [CHG] CAPE-OPEN: the state a host simulator saves for an embedded DWSIM component is now XML instead of a binary format.
- [CHG] PFR and CSTR: rate expressions are compiled once per calculation instead of at every integration step; the methane steam reforming sample solves in 0.17 s instead of 11.0 s.
- [CHG] Property correlations, kij expressions and equilibrium constants written as text are compiled once instead of at every evaluation.
- [CHG] Cross-platform interface: extenders, unit operations, property packages and plugins are read from the program folder, as on Windows.
- [CHG] Cross-platform interface: text boxes, combo boxes, spinners and check boxes match the height of the Windows fields.
- [CHG] Cross-platform interface: the compound search ranks matches by similarity so the exact name comes first, selects the best match, and adds it on Enter.
- [CHG] Cross-platform interface: it uses the native system font (Segoe UI on Windows, San Francisco on macOS) for sharper text.
- [CHG] Patreon benefits bar: an Annual Membership option, and the join buttons hide once a valid key is verified.
- [FIX] A product of a CAPE-OPEN unit operation was re-flashed by the flowsheet property package, throwing away the phase split the unit had computed.
- [FIX] Object editors were cut off on a display set above 96 dots per inch; the distillation column stage table was the most visible case.
- [FIX] A flowsheet opened from the desktop on macOS started DWSIM with nothing loaded and reported an unsupported file.
- [FIX] Peng-Robinson, PR78 and SRK: the lowest-Gibbs root could settle on a root below the covolume, which describes no real state.
- [FIX] CAPE-OPEN property packages could not drive a plug flow reactor, and a simulation saved on one silently reopened on a different property package.
- [FIX] Peng-Robinson, PR78 and SRK: the compressibility factor was always taken from the smallest root of the cubic, so a gas could be reported as a liquid.
- [FIX] Equilibrium reactor: only the activity and fugacity bases converged; every other basis reported zero conversion, and the concentration bases were rejected outright.
- [FIX] Heat exchanger: property overrides were ignored in the internal iterations, so the two sides of the energy balance disagreed.
- [FIX] Compound creator: the regression of vapour pressure and liquid viscosity started from a guess that overflows outside room temperature.
- [FIX] Shell and Tube heat exchanger: the number of shells in series was ignored by the area and the LMTD correction, so adding shells changed nothing; simulations with more than one shell will now report a higher duty.
- [FIX] Heat exchangers: the heat exchange profile was drawn for the maximum possible duty, so the Minimum Internal Temperature Approach read zero on every exchanger; it now follows the actual duty and is signed.
- [FIX] CAPE-OPEN: DWSIM released the stream belonging to the simulator hosting it, which could corrupt the host program.
- [FIX] CAPE-OPEN: a property package saved by a host could never be loaded back; the save and the load disagreed on where the data was.
- [FIX] CAPE-OPEN: a hosted property package was never sent the Terminate call the standard requires, and its interaction parameters were not saved.
- [FIX] CoolProp packages: a property asked for outside the accepted range ended the calculation instead of extrapolating.
- [FIX] CoolProp incompressible mixtures: the solvent vapour viscosity returned the liquid value, thirty times too large.
- [FIX] Binary phase envelope: the dew curve dipped below the bubble curve on heteroazeotropic systems.
- [FIX] PRSV2, PRSV2-VL, Lee-Kesler-Plocker, Chao-Seader and Grayson-Streed: stream enthalpy and entropy were missing the ideal-gas part, so energy balances and PH/PS flashes were wrong; existing simulations on these packages will report different, correct temperatures.
- [FIX] Dew point calculations could return the metastable liquid branch on partially miscible systems.
- [FIX] Water Electrolyzer: waste heat was added as a power instead of a specific enthalpy, overstating the temperature rise.
- [FIX] Shell and Tube heat exchanger: switching to Fouling Factor Calculation discarded the specified outlet temperatures.
- [FIX] Heat exchanger with steam tables on one side: the maximum duty came out negative and the exchanger did not calculate.
- [FIX] Steam Tables (IAPWS-IF97): states above 1073.15 K returned an impossible enthalpy instead of being refused.
- [FIX] Dynamic simulation: event transitions other than Step ended the run with a null-character error.
- [FIX] Dynamic simulation: the historian time slider could not restore a recorded state.
- [FIX] Flowsheet Unit Operation: a sub-flowsheet that failed to load reported an unrelated error later.
- [FIX] Control Valve: the opening table was read against the opening column, so the tabulated Kv was ignored.
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: the phase envelope dew curve drew a stray segment far past the critical point instead of ending there.
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: the phase envelope failed with "B = infinity" for mixtures whose compounds have no fusion temperature.
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: external unit operations (bioreactor, anaerobic digester) could not be added from the palette or the context menu.
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: premium, refining and biochemical unit operations were scattered across the generic palette sections instead of their own.
- [FIX] Cross-platform interface: the compressor and expander performance-curve editor did not open on the expander and could not create curves.

- [NEW] Anaerobic Digester: sulfur balance and H2S in biogas exposed in the editors and Fluent API
- [NEW] Electrolyte NRTL and Extended UNIQUAC: vapour-liquid equilibrium, so absorbers and strippers can be solved on these packages
- [NEW] Biomass Compound Creator: sulfur in the elemental formula, carried into the molar weight, the degree of reduction and the shipped biomass compounds
- [NEW] BioReactor: sulfur carrier compound closes the sulfur balance across the growth stoichiometry
- [NEW] Anaerobic Digester (ADM1-S): kinetic sulfate reduction with four sulfate-reducing populations competing with the methanogens, and H2S inhibition
- [CHG] Pump performance curves can now be scaled to the operating speed through the affinity laws
- [CHG] Liquid-liquid flash: spinodal seeding and Newton acceleration near the critical solution temperature
- [CHG] Analytical derivatives wired into the Electrolyte NRTL, Extended UNIQUAC and Glycol packages; sour-water stripper solves in about a third of the time
- [CHG] Analytical temperature derivatives for PRSV2-VL, Chao-Seader and Grayson-Streed
- [CHG] Electrolyte speciation about three times cheaper per call, with a warm start from recent solutions
- [CHG] Newton solver: line search now requires an Armijo sufficient decrease, instead of accepting a step that leaves the residual unchanged
- [FIX] Pump in Performance Curves mode: shaft power was zero when no power curve was supplied; flow rates outside the curve range are now rejected
- [FIX] Anaerobic Digester (ADM1 Full): integrator reached its step limit early and reported an early transient as steady state
- [FIX] Anaerobic Digester (ADM1): carbon and nitrogen balances did not close and pH inhibition left high pH uninhibited
- [FIX] Three-phase (VLLE) flash could stop before converging and mislabel the pressure/temperature outputs
- [FIX] Liquid-liquid flash failed to converge near and above the consolute temperature
- [FIX] Indicators (gauges): monitored value was passed to other blocks in SI units while labelled with the gauge display units
- [FIX] Equilibrium reactions: a Keq expression using Log(T), Exp() or Sqrt() silently evaluated to K = 1
- [FIX] Absorption column: top product was accounted for as a liquid distillate, so the closing mass balance rejected the solution
- [FIX] Absorption column: initial liquid traffic came from the feed connection order instead of the feed positions
- [FIX] Absorption column: steam-stripped columns did not converge; bottom-stage estimate and Sum-Rates temperature step corrected
- [FIX] Electrolyte NRTL and Extended UNIQUAC: equilibrium solver was missing the component balances, so speciation depended on initialisation
- [FIX] Electrolyte NRTL: activity coefficients were evaluated at the composition last loaded instead of the one requested
- [FIX] Electrolyte NRTL: the shared activity model was read and written concurrently by parallel column stages
- [FIX] Sour Water: vapour enthalpy gave a negative heat capacity above about 500 K, and the pressure-enthalpy flash could settle above the boiling point
- [FIX] Electrolyte NRTL and Extended UNIQUAC: speciation could fail at a composition it had just solved, because each solution seeds the next one
- [FIX] Electrolyte NRTL and Extended UNIQUAC: pressure-enthalpy and pressure-entropy flashes aborted on a single unevaluable point, leaving column products uncalculated
- [FIX] Electrolyte NRTL and Extended UNIQUAC: the three speciation retry passes were not distinct, so retrying could not recover a failure
- [FIX] BioReactor: growth stoichiometry was solved per mole of substrate but applied per C-mol, so mass was created in proportion to the substrate carbon number
- [FIX] Biomass compounds: stored molar weights and degrees of reduction disagreed with their own elemental formulas
