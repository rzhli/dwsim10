# Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

#### Overview

The **Life Cycle Assessment** (LCA) extension performs environmental impact assessment of chemical processes following the ISO 14040/14044 framework . It automates the construction of a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) from the converged DWSIM flowsheet, applies the CML 2001 baseline midpoint characterisation method , and normalises results to a user-defined functional unit.

#### LCA Methodology {#sec:lca_method}

The four-phase ISO 14040 framework is implemented as follows:

##### Phase 1: Goal and Scope Definition

Configured via the Study Setup tab:

- **Functional unit**: user selects a product stream and quantity (default: 1 kg of the largest product stream).

- **System boundary**: cradle-to-gate (includes upstream raw material production) or gate-to-gate (on-site process only).

- **Allocation**: mass-based, economic, or energy-based for multi-product systems.

- **Electricity grid mix**: selectable from 20 country/region profiles.

##### Phase 2: Life Cycle Inventory (LCI)

The inventory is built automatically from the flowsheet graph. The following flow types are identified:









Unit operations with no energy duty (valves, mixers, splitters, solid/component separators, orifice plates, Product Blender, etc.) are automatically skipped.

###### Compound matching

Each feed-stream compound is matched to the embedded emission-factor database (approximately 50 common process chemicals) using CAS number as the primary key and compound name as fallback. Emission factors represent cradle-to-gate impacts per kilogram of substance produced and are sourced from ecoinvent 3.9  and GREET 2023 .

###### Utility emissions

Electricity emission factors are provided for 20 country/region grid mixes based on IEA data . Heating emissions assume a natural gas-fired industrial boiler at 85 % thermal efficiency ($0.217$ kg CO$_2$-eq/kWh$_{\mathrm{th}}$ including upstream impacts). Cooling emissions are derived from the electricity consumption of mechanical-draft cooling towers ($\sim$<!-- -->0.02 kWh$_e$/kWh$_{\mathrm{th}}$).

###### Refinery operations {#sec:lca_refinery}

The 11 shortcut refinery unit operations from the *Refining Unit Operations* package emit or consume utilities that are captured automatically during inventory construction:

- **Hydrogen consumers**: the HDS and Hydrocracker units report hydrogen consumption via `Results.H2Consumption­KgPerS`. This is added as a *Raw Material* inventory item with CAS 1333-74-0, enabling the cradle-to-gate environmental burden of industrial H$_2$ production to be attributed to these units.

- **Endothermic reactors with fired heaters**: the Catalytic Reformer, Isomerization, and Delayed Coker report a feed-heater duty via `Results.HeaterDuty`. This is added as a *Heating* inventory item and uses the natural-gas boiler emission factor.

- **FCC regenerator direct emissions**: the Fluid Catalytic Cracker burns coke on the regenerated catalyst. CO$_2$ emissions are computed from $m_{\mathrm{coke}} \times 0.85 \times (44/12)$ (assuming coke is $\sim$<!-- -->85 wt % carbon) and SO$_2$ from $m_{\mathrm{coke}} \times w_{\mathrm{S,coke}} \times (64/32)$. Both are flagged as *DirectEmission* items.

- **Claus SRU tail gas**: the un-recovered fraction of the fed H$_2$S is assumed to be flared, producing SO$_2$. Tail-gas SO$_2$ is computed as $m_{\mathrm{H_2S}}(1 - \eta_{\mathrm{rec}}) \times (64/34)$.

- **Alkylation and Hydrocracker cooling**: the exothermic reaction duty is treated as a cooling-utility demand (mechanical-draft cooling tower emission factor).

- **Amine circulation pump**: electricity demand is estimated at $\sim$<!-- -->2 kW/(L/s) of amine flow rate reported by `Results.AmineCirculationLPerS`.

- **Shortcut CDU crude furnace**: the fired heater duty is approximated as $\sim$<!-- -->300 kJ/kg crude feed (a typical atmospheric distillation heat demand) and treated as a heating-utility item.

- **Passive units**: the Product Blender has no energy or emission contribution and is skipped.

###### PNA-aware inventory sensitivity

The hydrogen, coke, and fired-heater inventory items above are computed from the refining block results and therefore inherit any PNA-driven modulation of the underlying yields (see the *PNA-Aware Yield Modulation* subsection of the Refining Unit Operations chapter). In particular, an aromatic-rich feed to the Hydrocracker or HDS increases `H2ConsumptionKgPerS`, and with it the raw-material H$_2$ burden, relative to a paraffinic feed at the same throughput; an aromatic-rich Coker or FCC feed increases coke yield and the associated regenerator or coke-handling emissions. No additional configuration is required: the LCA inventory is rebuilt from the current `Results` of each block on every run.

###### Bio operations {#sec:lca_bio}

The six bio/biotech unit operations are detected by class name (independent of `ObjectType` because they inherit generic reactor / unit-op base classes) and dispatched to a dedicated bio handler. Their emissions and utility demands are captured as follows:

- **BioReactor**: the net heat duty `Result_Q_duty_kW` (computed from the metabolic heat balance and thermal mode) is added as either a *Heating* or *Cooling* item depending on sign. For aerobic fermentation this is typically cooling because the metabolic oxidation is exothermic ($\sim$<!-- -->450 kJ/mol O$_2$). Agitation/aeration electricity is estimated at $\sim$<!-- -->1 kW/m$^3$ working volume (standard stirred-tank bioreactor design basis).

- **Anaerobic Digester**: heating duty for maintaining mesophilic ($\sim$<!-- -->35 °C) or thermophilic ($\sim$<!-- -->55 °C) operating temperature is taken from `Result_Q_duty_kW`. The biogenic CO$_2$ output (`Result_CO2_kgs`) is flagged as a *DirectEmission* with CAS 124-38-9; the biogenic characterisation factor is conventionally zero under ISO 14067 but the flow is listed for transparency. Mixing electricity is estimated at $\sim$<!-- -->0.2 kW/m$^3$.

- **Biomass Pretreatment**: heating duty scales with feed mass flow via a technology-specific specific energy (DiluteAcid 500 kJ/kg, SteamExplosion 1500 kJ/kg, Alkaline 300 kJ/kg, Organosolv 800 kJ/kg). Chemical consumption is added as a *Raw Material* input with its upstream cradle-to-gate emission factor: 1 wt % H$_2$SO$_4$ for DiluteAcid (CAS 7664-93-9), 2 wt % NaOH for Alkaline (CAS 1310-73-2), or 5 % of 0.5 kg/kg Ethanol make-up for Organosolv (CAS 64-17-5).

- **Cell Lysis**: electricity depends on technology: high-pressure homogeniser uses $0.0005 \times\mathrm{passes}\times
      p_{\mathrm{MPa}}$ kWh/kg (which gives $\sim$<!-- -->0.08 kWh/kg at 2 passes and 80 MPa); bead-mill $\sim$<!-- -->0.1 kWh/kg; ultrasound uses `Ultrasound_PowerDensity_WmL` directly scaled by flow; chemical / enzymatic / osmotic modes have negligible direct energy.

- **Biogas Upgrader**: technology-dependent electricity and heat (per kg raw biogas):

  - *WaterScrubbing*: 0.25 kWh$_e$/kg, no heat.

  - *Amine*: 0.15 kWh$_e$/kg + 0.6 kWh$_{\mathrm{th}}$/kg (regenerator).

  - *PSA*: 0.30 kWh$_e$/kg.

  - *MembraneSeparation*: 0.20 kWh$_e$/kg.

  CH$_4$ slip (from `CH4LossFraction`) is added as a *DirectEmission* with CAS 74-82-8 to capture its GWP$_{100}$ = 28 impact, which is the hotspot of a biogas-upgrading LCA.

- **CFB Fast Pyrolysis**: the LCI is split by sand-supply mode (`SandMode`):

  - *External* mode: the net pyrolysis duty `Result_PyrolysisDuty_kW` is supplied by an external heat source (natural-gas boiler or high-temperature utility sand) and is added as a *Heating* item.

  - *InternalCharCombustor* mode: the reactor is autothermal: char is burned in-situ to regenerate hot sand. No external heat is consumed, but the combustion generates a biogenic CO$_2$ direct emission estimated at $m_{\mathrm{CO_2}} = 3.12 \, m_{\mathrm{char}}$ (from $m_{\mathrm{char}} = m_{\mathrm{biomass}} \times
            w_{\mathrm{char,yield}}$, assuming $\sim$<!-- -->85 % carbon in char and full conversion to CO$_2$). Biogenic CO$_2$ has a characterisation factor of 0 under ISO 14067 but is listed for transparency.

  Both modes share: carrier-gas blower electricity for the fluidisation N$_2$ stream ($\sim$<!-- -->0.05 kWh per kg biomass feed) and pneumatic sand-lift electricity ($\sim$<!-- -->0.02 kWh per kg sand circulated, using `Result_SandCirculation_kgps`). The reactor is also covered by the double-count guard.

To prevent double-counting, the reactor-outlet emission scanner in the inventory builder skips any object whose class name matches a bio unit operation; their emissions are already captured explicitly above.

##### Phase 3: Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA)

The LCIA applies the CML 2001 baseline midpoint method . For each impact category $j$, the total impact is computed as:


<a id="eq:lcia"></a>

\[
I_j = \sum_{i} m_i \times \mathrm{CF}_{i,j}
\]


where $m_i$ is the annual mass of substance $i$ (kg/year) and $\mathrm{CF}_{i,j}$ is the characterisation factor for substance $i$ in impact category $j$.

The seven impact categories are:







| **Category** | **Abbreviation** | **Unit** | **Reference Substance** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Global Warming Potential | GWP$_{100}$ | kg CO$_2$-eq | CO$_2$ ($\mathrm{CF}=1$) |
| Acidification Potential | AP | kg SO$_2$-eq | SO$_2$ ($\mathrm{CF}=1$) |
| Eutrophication Potential | EP | kg PO$_4$-eq | PO$_4^{3-}$ |
| Ozone Depletion Potential | ODP | kg CFC-11-eq | CFC-11 ($\mathrm{CF}=1$) |
| Photochemical Ozone Creation | POCP | kg C$_2$H$_4$-eq | Ethylene ($\mathrm{CF}=1$) |
| Human Toxicity Potential | HTP | kg DCB-eq | 1,4-Dichlorobenzene |
| Abiotic Depletion (fossil fuels) | ADP$_{\mathrm{fossil}}$ | MJ | Fossil fuel energy |



###### Global Warming Potential

GWP$_{100}$ values follow IPCC AR5 : CO$_2 = 1$, CH$_4 = 28$, N$_2$O $= 265$, CFC-11 $= 4660$, CFC-12 $= 10200$, HCFC-22 $= 1760$, CO $= 1.57$.

###### Normalisation to functional unit

Total annual impacts are normalised to the functional unit:


<a id="eq:norm"></a>

\[
I_j^{\mathrm{FU}} = I_j \times \frac{m_{\mathrm{FU}}}{m_{\mathrm{product,annual}}}
\]


where $m_{\mathrm{FU}}$ is the functional unit mass (e.g., 1 kg) and $m_{\mathrm{product,annual}}$ is the total annual production.

##### Phase 4: Interpretation

The plant-wide form provides:

- **Contribution analysis**: per-unit-operation breakdown of all impact categories (GWP, AP, EP, ADP), with percentage contributions and dominant category identification.

- **Hotspot identification**: automatic highlighting of the top 3 contributors for *each* impact category.

- **Sensitivity to grid mix**: users can change the electricity grid region and re-run to assess the effect on results.

- **AI-assisted interpretation**: LLM-generated expert analysis of results with improvement recommendations.

#### Normalization and Weighting {#sec:lca_normweight}

Characterised impacts can be normalised and aggregated into a single score.

###### Normalisation

Normalised impacts are computed as:


<a id="eq:lca_norm"></a>

\[
I_j^{\mathrm{norm}} = \frac{I_j^{\mathrm{FU}}}{R_j}
\]


where $R_j$ is the CML 2001 world reference value for impact category $j$ (world total, year 2000):







| **Category** | **Reference Value**     | **Unit**               |
|:-------------|:------------------------|:-----------------------|
| GWP          | $4.22 \times 10^{13}$ | kgCO$_2$-eq/yr       |
| AP           | $2.39 \times 10^{11}$ | kgSO$_2$-eq/yr       |
| EP           | $1.58 \times 10^{11}$ | kgPO$_4$-eq/yr       |
| ODP          | $2.27 \times 10^{8}$  | kgCFC-11-eq/yr         |
| POCP         | $3.68 \times 10^{10}$ | kgC$_2$H$_4$-eq/yr |
| HTP          | $2.58 \times 10^{12}$ | kgDCB-eq/yr            |
| ADP          | $3.80 \times 10^{14}$ | MJ/yr                  |



###### Weighting

The weighted single score is:


<a id="eq:lca_single"></a>

\[
S = \sum_j I_j^{\mathrm{norm}} \times \frac{w_j}{100}
\]


where $w_j$ is the user-assigned weight (%) for category $j$. Default weights are: GWP = 30, HTP = 20, AP/EP/ODP/POCP/ADP = 10 each. The weights are editable in the Normalization & Weighting tab grid.

#### System Boundary {#sec:lca_boundary}

Two boundary options are available :

###### Cradle-to-gate

Includes the environmental burden of producing all raw materials (upstream impacts from the emission-factor database) plus on-site process impacts (utilities, direct emissions).

###### Gate-to-gate

Includes only on-site process impacts. Upstream raw material impacts are excluded; raw material flows are still listed in the inventory for mass-balance purposes but carry zero environmental burden.

#### Characterisation Factor Database

The embedded characterisation factor database contains CML 2001 baseline midpoint factors for 15 common direct-emission substances (to air compartment). Key entries include:







| **Substance** | **GWP** | **AP** | **EP** | **ODP** | **POCP** |
|:--------------|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| CO$_2$      |   1.0   |   —    |   —    |    —    |  0.006   |
| CH$_4$      |   28    |   —    |   —    |    —    |  0.006   |
| N$_2$O      |   265   |   —    |   —    |  0.017  |    —     |
| SO$_2$      |    —    |  1.0   |   —    |    —    |  0.048   |
| NO$_x$      |    —    |  0.7   |  0.13  |    —    |  0.028   |
| NH$_3$      |    —    |  1.88  |  0.35  |    —    |    —     |



#### Electricity Grid Mix Database

Carbon intensity values (kg CO$_2$-eq/kWh) are provided for 20 regions based on IEA and national grid data :







| **Region**     | **kg CO$_2$/kWh** | **Region**     | **kg CO$_2$/kWh** |
|:---------------|:-------------------:|:---------------|:-------------------:|
| World Average  |        0.475        | France         |        0.052        |

#### Programmatic API {#sec:lca_api}

The `LCAApi` static class provides a programmatic interface for running a complete life cycle assessment from code.

##### Basic Usage

    using DWSIM.Extensions.LifeCycleAssessment;

    // Run LCA with default settings
    LCAApiResult result = LCAApi.Analyze(flowsheet);

    // Access key impacts (per functional unit)
    double gwp = result.GWP;   // kg CO2-eq per FU
    double ap  = result.AP;    // kg SO2-eq per FU
    double ep  = result.EP;    // kg PO4-eq per FU

    // Access annual totals
    double gwpAnnual = result.GWP_Annual;

    // Identify hotspots
    foreach (string hotspot in result.Hotspots)
        Console.WriteLine($"Hotspot: {hotspot}");

    // Get the full Markdown report
    string report = result.MarkdownReport;

##### Custom Settings

    var settings = new LCASettings
    {
        SystemBoundary = SystemBoundaryType.CradleToGate,
        ElectricityGridRegion = "European Union",
        OperatingHoursPerYear = 8000,
        IncludeUpstreamEmissions = true,
        IncludeDirectEmissions = true,
        IncludeUtilityEmissions = true
    };
    LCAApiResult result = LCAApi.Analyze(flowsheet, settings);

##### Result Structure

The `LCAApiResult` class contains:

- **Scope**: `FunctionalUnit` (description string), `AnnualProductionFU` (annual production in functional units).

- **Per-FU impacts**: `GWP`, `AP`, `EP`, `ODP`, `POCP`, `HTP`, `ADP`.

- **Annual impacts**: `GWP_Annual`, `AP_Annual`, `EP_Annual`, `ODP_Annual`, `POCP_Annual`, `HTP_Annual`, `ADP_Annual`.

- **Detailed breakdown**: `Impacts`, `Contributions`, `Hotspots` (top 3 contributor names).

- **Inventory**: `InventorySummary` (counts by flow type) and `Inventory` (full list of inventory items).

- **Report**: `MarkdownReport`, the complete analysis in Markdown format.

The API automatically stores all results in the flowsheet’s `ExtraProperties` (see table above), making them accessible to other extensions, scripts, and the DWSIM AI assistant.
